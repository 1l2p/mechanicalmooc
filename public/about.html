	<p>Learning Creative Learning is a course offered at the <a href="http://media.mit.edu">MIT Media Lab</a>. It introduces ideas and strategies for designing technologies to support creative learning. We invited some of the best thinkers and builders in this space to join our conversations and you'll get a chance to experiment with lots of different projects - many of which were developed in the Lifelong Kindergarten group right here at the Lab.</p>

	<p>This semester, for the first time, P2PU and the Media Lab are working together to bring the course online. We are opening up the seminars, course materials, and hands-on activities to anyone with a computer and Internet access. It's a big experiment, we expect to learn a lot, and we hope you'll enjoy it.</p>

	<p><h3>Who created this course?</h3></p>

	<p>Learning Creative Learning is offered by Mitch Resnick, who is the director of Lifelong Kindergarten and the LEGO Papert Professor at the MIT Media Lab. He has been a pioneer in technology & learning for a looooooong time. And has built such wonderful things as <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>, the <a href="http://www.computerclubhouse.org/">Computer Clubhouse</a>, and <a href="http://llk.media.mit.edu/projects.php?id=135">Programmable Bricks</a>, a collaboration with the LEGO Company. More about Mitch is <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~mres/">here</a>.</p>

	<p>For this course Mitch has been working closely with Natalie Rusk, a Research Scientist in the Lifelong Kindergarten group, and Philipp Schmidt, Executive Director of P2PU and a MIT Media Lab Director's Fellow. Natalie is a specialist in motivation for learning. Philipp is interested in creating better ways for people to learn with each other online.</p>

       	<p><h3>How is this going to work? What will I be learning and doing?</h3></p>

	<p>You will get a chance to analyze learning technologies, discuss educational concepts like interest-based learning and learning through tinkering, examine and develop design principles, and create new prototypes and applications. There will be weekly readings, reflection and discussion, and project-based activities. We decided not to focus on a big course-project, but you are encouraged to go deeper on any of the weekly activities you find particularly interesting.</p>

       <p><h3>An online experiment, learning by the seats of our pants</h3></p>

       <p>What you are looking at here is a BIG experiment. This semester, for the first time, we are opening the course to online participants. In the spirit of the course, we hope that participants will jump in as collaborators rather than passive recipients of information. We want to tinker together. Things will break, but we are committed to fixing them along the way. We invite you to break and fix things together with us.</p>

          <p><h3>Check out our shiny new platform</h3></p>

          <p>Actually, don’t, because we didn’t build a shiny new platform. Our platform is the web and we like things distributed and open. We also wanted to create a model that is easy to replicate for anyone, which influenced our choice of technology. We use off-the-shelf Google+ features, like Hangouts and Google+ communities; and open source software like the Mechanical MOOC (github). You have no excuse not to build a course like this yourself!</p>

          <p><h3>Open critique</h3></p>

          <p>One of the big challenges of online learning is to give more people access to the experience and wisdom of someone with a lot of experience and expertise in a particular field. The studio model of learning, which is pretty much how things work at the Media Lab, is hard to move online. But we'll try. We will organize a studio feedback session in which Mitch and Natalie will invite some of the online students to present and discuss their work.</p>
