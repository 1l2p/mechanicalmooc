<body style="margin: 0; font-family: sense, helvetica, sans-serif;">

<p>
<strong>Welcome fellow creative learners!</strong>
</p>

<p>
We are excited that you registered for the course. Before we kick things off, we'd like to ask, "Is this still a good time for you?"
</p>

<p>
<strong>Important -- Please confirm if you want to participate in the course starting 11 February </strong>
</p>

<p>
It's easy. Just click one of the links below (please don't send your reply by email!). We really need you to do this and will not group you with other users unless we receive the confirmation. Not sure yet? Please read on to find out what is expected from participants and to decide if this is for you, right now.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<strong>Ready to start the course?</strong>
</p>

<p align="center"><a href="%LINK_DEFER_YES%" style="padding:15px;background-color:#51a351;color:white;display:inline-block;width:auto; text-align:center;-webkit-border-radius: 5px;-moz-border-radius: 5px;border-radius: 5px;text-decoration:none">Yes - I can't wait to work with my group. Let's go, people!</a></p>

<p align="center"><a href="%LINK_DEFER_NO%" style="padding:15px;background-color:#faa732;color:white;display:inline-block;width:auto; text-align:center;-webkit-border-radius: 5px;-moz-border-radius: 5px;border-radius: 5px;text-decoration:none">No - I'm actually a little busy at the moment. I'd rather do the course later.</a></p>

<p>
<strong>Why do I have to confirm? Because your team needs you!</strong>
</p>

<p>
Those who sign-up will be placed in small groups, work on individual projects, review and discuss each other's work and hopefully participate for the duration of the course. The other members of your group rely on you to add your voice to the conversations and give feedback. 
</p>

<p>
We've had more than 10,000 people register and while that is super exciting it also means that the course facilitators, including Mitch and Natalie, won't be able to participate much in the online groups. We are here to create the basic structure and support the community as much as we can, but we rely on you to bring the course to life. 
</p>

<p>
If you think it'll be hard to keep up, you can always defer until the next round. And even if you don't sign up, you'll be able to watch all seminar videos and even participate in the main G+ community.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Now what?</strong>
</p>

<p>
If you said Yes above, we will group you and send your further information over the weekend. And here are a few suggestions to get started right away: 
<ul>
  <li>Join the <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/1/communities/106132864609383396284">G+ community</a> for the course and introduce yourself</li>
  <li>Add yourself to the <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=210189659073890490806.0004d4d77ae8480ac9849&msa=0">map of participants</a>, which was created by Adriano Parracciani, one of the other participants.</li>
  <li>Check out the reading for week 1: <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~mres/papers/CC2007-handout.pdf">All I Really Need to Know (About Creative Thinking) I Learned (By Studying How Children Learn) in Kindergarten</a> </li>
  <li>If you want to watch the first seminar live, please <strong>block Monday 11 Feb, 10:30am-11:30am</strong> (US Eastern Standard Time) in your calendar!</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Cheerio, </strong>
</p>

<p>
from the Team and from Oliver (that's the name of the Machine)
</p>

<p>
PS: Why Oliver? Because Jeff Cowles argued that "Oliver sounded somewhat formal (without sounding too much like a clich√© butler) yet youthful at the same time." And we agreed.
