<p><strong>Hooray - Here it is - The grouping email for Learning Creative Learning</strong></p>

<p>Thanks again for joining us in the <a href="http://learn.media.mit.edu/">Learning Creative Learning course</a>. We split all 24,000 of you into small groups and set up a mini mailing list for each. This is the first message we are sending to your group.</p>

<p><strong>This is your group speaking...</strong></p>

<p>This email was sent only to your group. A group works like a mini mailing list. If you hit reply, the message will only go to the other members in your group. <u>We will be sending you all the announcements and weekly activities by email to this group.</u> If you asked us to, we tried to group you with your friends. Otherwise we grouped participants by timezone (we'll explain later why we did that).</p>

<p><strong>Your group needs you!</strong></p>

<p>Think of the group as a team or a cohort. The collaborators with whom you discuss your ideas, share work in progress, give feedback and receive feedback. The other members of your group rely on you to add your voice to the conversations. We've had more than 24,000 people register and while that is super exciting it also means that the course facilitators, won't be able to participate in these groups. We created the basic structure and we are here to help and support as much as we can, but it's your curiosity and contributions that will bring this course to life.</p>

<p><strong>Let's get to know each other - Time for introductions!</strong></p>

<p>Why not hit reply and send a short introduction email to the other members in your group? Where are you from? What got you interested in this course and why are you excited to participate?</p>

<p>We are also building a gallery of video instructions, because it will be awesome to see all the different perspectives and backgrounds. If you want to be in it, please record a super short introduction video (max 30 sec), tell us why you're excited to participate, upload it to <a href="http://youtube.com">youtube.com</a> or <a href="http://vimeo.com">vimeo.com</a>, and send us a link through <a href="http://bit.ly/lclvideo">this form</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have plans for tomorrow yet?</strong></p>

<p>Why not join the first session of the class at 10am (US Eastern Time) on Feb 10th? Don't worry if the time doesn't work out or you miss a session. All sessions are recorded and you can watch them at any time that is convenient. There is also a helpful calendar that lists all future sessions <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=po09dc728rriivgq9fp38kfjts@group.calendar.google.com">here</a>.</p>

<p>All the details about tomorrow's session are in this <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/1/events/cfsemq6ndhei8uo6thqaa2n2frk">Event invitation</a>.</p>

<p><strong>You want us to use email? This is 2013!!!</strong></p>

<p>We like email, and that's how we will communicate to your group, but there are lots of other good tools out there you may prefer. In your group, please discuss if you want to create other spaces to share and collaborate. One of you will have to set them up. Our suggestion would be to create a <a href="http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/communities/">Google+ community</a> because that's what we use for the entire course (see below). But there are lots of great alternatives. It's up to your group to decide. And it's totally fine to just stick to email and use this mailing list. Old school!</p>

<p><strong>The BIG Google+ community</strong></p>

<p>There is another community space we want to tell you about. It's a Googe+ community for everyone who signed-up for the course (and anyone else interested in creative learning). If your group is like a little village, then this <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/1/communities/106132864609383396284">Google+ community for Learning Creative Learning</a> is like a huge metropolis. It already has thousands of members. It's busy and sometimes confusing, but also exciting and vibrant. Consider joining and dipping in and out of the conversations as you like (Don't try to keep up with everything. Trust us on this one!).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ok folks, this course is officially on its way. We are seriously excited and we hope you are too. Talk to you soon!</p>
